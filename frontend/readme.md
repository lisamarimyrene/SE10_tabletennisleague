# Fullstack Exam Project
Lisa Mari Myrene, Anosh Chaudhry & Alexandra Eloise Vanje

## Deploy & install application (frontend)

1. To clone the project (link):

   https://github.com/ntnu-design/idg2100-2023-final-exam-tabletennisleague 

2. Start a new terminal and go inside the frontend folder: `cd frontend`. You are going to run the frontend folder and the backend folder on two seperate terminals. 

3. Run the provided installing script by typing `npm run frontend` in the terminal. 

This script will install all dependencies and dev dependencies, and then start the React application in the terminal.

If you managed to stop the React application and want to restart it, you can type `npm run dev` in the terminal (be sure to be inside the frontend folder).

### Storybook

To run storybook: `npm run storybook`

## Other

The frontend part of this project is based on oblig1 and oblig3 (by Lisa Mari Myrene and Anosh Chaudhry) of the IDG2100 Fullstack course. 
That acts like a basis, and then all group members we have further developed it with new and updated functionalities. 

The project is based on what we have learned in the Fullstack course. Otherwise it's stated in the code.
